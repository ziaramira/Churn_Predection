<b>Customer churn </b> is a big problem and one of the biggest concerns of companies. Especially in the telecom industry, it has a direct impact on the revenue of mobile companies. Therefore, 
predicting customer attrition has become an important research topic in this industry. This project focuses on developing churn prediction models that allow telecom operators to predict which
customers are likely to leave their services. To develop efficient models for this purpose, we are implement different machine learning algorithms such as <b>logistic regression (LR), support
vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) from scratch </b> and choose the best-performing model.
